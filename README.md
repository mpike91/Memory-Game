# Memory Game
Simple memory game where user must click on two tiles to "flip" them over, revealing their color. Select all matching colored tiles to win. Local storage tracks the best score. Practice with DOM manipulation and timers.

## My Contribution
Some skeletal starter code was provided to generate divs as the "tiles", but I had to write all functions to make the game work, as well as implement basic styling.
